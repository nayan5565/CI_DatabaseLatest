          Description:
          This PHP script, splits the files into smaller pieces in binary.
          It is compatiple with HJSplit, so you can re-join splitted files using HJSplit's Join utility.
          It can split a file up to 999 pieces.

          What is the use, why will I use this?
          Some webmasters do not have shell access to their websites. This prevents them splitting big files, ie. MySQL backups, into smaller files. Splitting a 200Mb file into 10 x 20Mb file may be easy on webmaster to download in pieces.

          How to run:
          Make sure your webserver has write permission on the target folder.
          Edit variables.
          Upload (ftp) this file to your webserver or run on your PC.
          For security reason, filename is hardcoded. You can modify code to accept $_GET['filename']

          Run with your favorite browser.
          http://www.<your-web-site>.com/filesplit.php
          Or run on shell (ie. ssh)
          php filesplit.php

          It is Ok to share and modify this code and use in/with your applications. No restrictions.
